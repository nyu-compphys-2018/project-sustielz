The folder "currend code" contains the most up-to-date/most organized code, as of 12/10/18. 

	-   Code should be troubleshooted against older versions in "backup" code if problems are encountered. In particular, slight 
	differences in performance have been found, but for the most part the two codes operate the same.

The folder "backup code" contains an older code which works somewhat more reliably. However, it uses less object-oriented programming 
and is somewhat more confusing/less elegant. Still need to troubleshoot the differences between this code and the "main" code.
